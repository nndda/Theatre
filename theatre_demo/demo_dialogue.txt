    "Welcome to the Theatre!{delay = 0.5} Hi there!{delay = 0.4}
    this is a demo dialogue to demonstrate Theatre plugin's core feature."

Dia:
    "There are 4 classes that makes part of Theatre plugin:{delay = 0.7}
    Dialogue, {delay = 0.7}
    DialogueLabel, {delay = 0.7}
    Stage, {delay = 0.7}
    and Theatre"

Dia:
    "`Dialogue` are resources that contains the play of the... {delay = 0.2} well,{delay = 0.4} dialogue!{delay = 0.7}
    It uses a simple syntax, that can be written in plain text files.{delay = 0.4} Or,{delay = 0.1} since
    what it do is just parse a string of text,{delay = 0.2} you can write it directly
    when creating the Dialogue variable!"
