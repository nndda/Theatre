# Features

## Dialogue tags

Fine-tune your dialogue flow with `{delay}` and `{speed}`.
```yaml
Godette:
    "Hello!{delay = 0.7} Nice to meet you."
```
```yaml
Godette:
    "Hello!
        delay=0.7
    Nice to meet you."
```

## Function calls

Connect your story to the game with function calls.
```yaml
{player_name}:
    "Thanks! That feels so much better."

    Player.heal(20)
```
```yaml
Ritsu:
    "Cheers!"

    Portrait.set("ritsu_smile.png")
```

Call functions only at specific points in the Dialogue.
```yaml
Dia:
    "Let's brighten up the room a little...{d = 1.1}
    {0}
    there we go."

# Call this function using its index: {0}
    Background.set_brightness(1.0)
```

# (Very) Quick Start

Write your epic Dialogue!
```gdscript
# Write it directly with triple quotation marks.
var epic_dialogue = Dialogue.new("""

Dia:
    "Loading the Dialogue, written in a *.dlg file
    is much better for performance."
:
    "It'll keep things clean and efficient."
:
    "Plus, you‚Äôll have syntax highlighting
    for better readibility."

""")

# Write it in a *.dlg file, and load it.
# (Just use this, for the reason explained above.)
var epic_dialogue = Dialogue.load("res://epic_dialogue.dlg")
```

Set the Stage! Add `Stage` and `DialogueLabel` node to your scene. Structure your scene like the following:

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05e5e3ba-adfb-4208-81bc-adbbf6b6c571" alt="A scene tree, with Stage and PanelContainer > VBoxContainer > Label, DialogueLabel" width="207" height="302">
</div>

<br>

Adjust the position and size of the `PanelContainer` to your liking.

Select the `Stage` node, and reference the `Label` & `DialogueLabel` node to display your Dialogue. Adjust and configure your `Stage` via the inspector. Alternatively, you can also set them in script:

<table align="center">
<tr align="center">
<td>
    <b> Inspector </b>
</td>
<td>
    <b> GDScript </b>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

<img src="https://github.com/nndda/Theatre/assets/96333146/69d7b946-2444-4247-8cdf-394332466c99" alt="Inspector dock's representation of Stage's properties." width="261" height="235">

</td>
<td>

```gdscript
@onready var my_stage : Stage = $Stage

func _ready():
    my_stage.actor_label =\
        $PanelContainer/VBoxContainer/Label
    my_stage.dialogue_label =\
        $PanelContainer/VBoxContainer/DialogueLabel

    my_stage.allow_skip = true
    my_stage.allow_cancel = true
    my_stage.allow_func = true
    my_stage.speed_scale = 1.0
```

</td>
</tr>

</table>

Reference the `Stage` node in the script, and set up a way to progress your Dialogue with `Stage.progress()`.

```gdscript
func _input(event):
    if event.is_action_pressed("ui_accept"):
        my_stage.progress()
```

And finally, start the `Stage` with your `epic_dialogue`.

```gdscript
func _ready():
    my_stage.start(epic_dialogue)
```
